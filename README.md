# NAR
Nursing Assistant Robot

This python code was written in the process of developing a robot to assist nurses in hospital wards by monitoring patients. The bot used a "Raspberry pi 3 Model B" to compile and execute the program.
The files named "code 1" and "code 2", are the pythin files that are run on the Pi. The Arduino code handles the navigation of the robot. Other than that, the program makes use of face recognition, avaiable in open CV 3.3.1 and Google API for speech recognition.
